   <h2>Chess Pieces Names:</h2>  
   <dl>

    <dt><b> King</b> </dt>
    <dd>This is the most important piece in the game. The King can only move one square at a time but two square max when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling" target="_blank"><b>Castling</b></a></dd>
    <dt><b>Queen (9 points)</b></dt>
    <dd>The queen has the value among the capturable pieces as it can move in all direction. The queen is mostly priortized in a trade of pieces as losing  a queen for a less valuable piece is often bad</dd>
    <dt><b>Rook (5 points)</b></dt>
    <dd>This is the next valuable piece after the Queen . The rook can move horizontally or vertically in the chess board and is often paired with the queen for a <b>Standard ladder mate</b> or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-rank_checkmate" target="_blank"><b>Back-Rank Checkamte</b></a></dd>
    <dt><b>Knight (3 points)</b></dt>
    <dd>The knight is a piece that has unique a type of movemment. It moves in a L-Shape helping it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(chess)" target="_blank"><b>Fork</b></a> other pieces. This piece is best suitable for taking control of the center in the beginning of the rounds.</dd>     
    <dt><b>Bishop (3 points)</b></dt>
    <dd>The Bishop has the same value as the knight but is more priortised due to its diagonal movement helping in preventing castling and often threatning to capture a rook as the bisop is out of its movement range</dd>
    <dt><b>Pawn (1 point)</b></dt>
    <dd>The Pawn is the least valued piece as it has very less movement range of one block straight forward or diagonally when capturing a piece. But this piece has a special ability ; If it reaches the other end of the board it can promote into any other piece including a queen making it very powerful in endgames </dd>

  <P><h2>Movement</h2>
    
    White moves first, after which players alternate turns, moving one piece per turn (except for castling, when two pieces are moved). A piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent's piece, which is captured and removed from play. With the sole exception of en passant, all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent's piece occupies. Moving is compulsory; a player may not skip a turn, even when having to move is detrimental.
    
    Each piece has its own way of moving. In the diagrams, crosses mark the squares to which the piece can move if there are no intervening piece(s) of either color (except the knight, which leaps over any intervening pieces). All pieces except the pawn can capture an enemy piece if it is on a square to which they could move if the square were unoccupied.</P>

    <br>

    <p>The king moves one square in any direction. There is also a special move called castling that involves moving the king and a rook. The king is the most valuable pieceâ€”attacks on the king must be immediately countered,
     and if this is impossible, the game is immediately lost (see Check and checkmate below).</p>

    <p>A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces
    . Along with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.</p>

    <p>A bishop can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.</p>

    <p>A queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.</p>

    <p>A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (Thus the move forms an "L"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.)
     The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.</p>

    <p>A pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied (black dots in the diagram). 
    A pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it by moving to that square (black crosses).
     It cannot capture a piece while advancing along the same file. A pawn has two special moves: the en passant capture and promotion.</p>
